# Multi-Stage-Image-Enhancement-and-Analysis-Pipeline
This repository contains the code and deployment of our Computer Vision project. The project is designed as a multi-stage image processing pipeline where each stage applies a different computer vision algorithm. The aim is to enhance images while allowing each team member to contribute a unique algorithm.
